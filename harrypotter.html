    <p id="firstPara">This is the tale of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), an ordinary eleven-year-old boy serving as a
        sort of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the
        Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus Hagrid
        (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely foreign to both
        him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes friends easily at his new
        school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have
        imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.</p>
    <p id="firstPara">Actors: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson</p>
