    <p id="firstPara">Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood
        with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his
        destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins
        medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the
        smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this
        is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her
        life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone.</p>
