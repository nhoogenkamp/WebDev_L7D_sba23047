    <p id="firstPara">The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. He is at
        the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated WW II Marine is also present
        at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part of the family business. Vito is a powerful man,
        and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and
        treacherous rival wants to sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What
        follows is a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the thing he
        was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families which could tear the
        Corleone family apart</p>
