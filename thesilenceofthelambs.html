    <p id="firstPara">F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) works hard to advance her career, while trying to
        hide or put behind her West Virginia roots, of which if some knew, would automatically classify her as being
        backward or white trash. After graduation, she aspires to work in the agency's Behavioral Science Unit under the
        leadership of Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn). While she is still a trainee, Crawford asks her to question Dr.
        Hannibal Lecter (Sir Anthony Hopkins), a psychiatrist imprisoned, thus far, for eight years in maximum security
        isolation for being a serial killer who cannibalized his victims. Clarice is able to figure out the assignment
        is to pick Lecter's brains to help them solve another serial murder case, that of someone coined by the media as
        "Buffalo Bill" (Ted Levine), who has so far killed five victims, all located in the eastern U.S., all young
        women, who are slightly overweight (especially around the hips), all who were drowned in natural bodies of
        water, and all who were stripped of large swaths of skin. She also figures that Crawford chose her, as a woman,
        to be able to trigger some emotional response from Lecter. After speaking to Lecter for the first time, she
        realizes that everything with him will be a psychological game, with her often having to read between the very
        cryptic lines he provides. She has to decide how much she will play along, as his request in return for talking
        to him is to expose herself emotionally to him. The case takes a more dire turn when a sixth victim is
        discovered, this one from who they are able to retrieve a key piece of evidence, if Lecter is being forthright
        as to its meaning. A potential seventh victim is high profile Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of
        Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), which places greater scrutiny on the case as they search for a hopefully
        still alive Catherine. Who may factor into what happens is Dr. Frederick Chilton (Anthony Heald), the warden at
        the prison, an opportunist who sees the higher profile with Catherine, meaning a higher profile for himself if
        he can insert himself successfully into the proceedings.</p>
