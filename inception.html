    <p id="firstPara">Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing
        valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most
        vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate
        espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now
        Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can
        accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to
        pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the
        perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that
        seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.</p>
